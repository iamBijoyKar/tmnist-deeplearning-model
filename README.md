# TMNIST Deep Learning Model

This repository contains the implementation of a deep learning model for the TMNIST dataset. The TMNIST dataset is a modified version of the MNIST dataset, specifically designed for handwritten digit recognition tasks.

## Dataset

The TMNIST dataset source [https://www.kaggle.com/datasets/nikbearbrown/tmnist-alphabet-94-characters](https://www.kaggle.com/datasets/nikbearbrown/tmnist-alphabet-94-characters)

## Usage

To use this model, follow these steps:

1. Clone this repository: `git clone https://github.com/your-username/tmnist-deep-learning-model.git`
2. Install the required dependencies: `pip install -r requirements.txt`


## Results

After training the model, you can evaluate its performance on the test set. The accuracy achieved by the model on the TMNIST dataset is approximately 90%.
